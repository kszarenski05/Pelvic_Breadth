Title: Statistical Significance of Obesity and Pelvic Breadth

Purpose: This study examines the statistical significance between waist to height ratio(WHtR), Body mass index(BMI), and pelvic breadth in participants (n=507) aged 18 to 67. 
The skeletal measurements used originate from the pelvic area with bi-iliac measurement taken from the pelvic breadth, and bi-trochanteric measuring the diameter around what is typically the widest part of the hips.
